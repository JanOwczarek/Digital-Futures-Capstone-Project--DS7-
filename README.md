# Digital-Futures-Capstone-Project--DS7-
As I was part of the Digital Futures 7th data specialism cohort (09/01/2023-31/03/2023) a final and individual capstone project was completed in a time period of a week and a half. 
This project is about predicting a high and low-risk (of dying) COVID-19 patients. The general idea was that by being able to predict whether a patient is high-risk 
would drastically increase medical respource efficiency. This model could also be used for the same purpose for other similarly behaving viruses 
(e.g. ones affecting the respiratory system), of course whilst considering medical and biological knowledge. Naturally, I would have experimented a bit more with 
the data in this project if only I had more time. There are four python notebook files: one containing the Exploratory data analysis, one with the base models, 
logistic regression modelling and finally random forest modelling. Additionally, I have attached my presentation that I presented on the 31/03/2023 (final day of the academy).
The raw dataset from kaggle can be sourced from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meirnizri/covid19-dataset. 
I had a lot of fun exploring and analysing this dataset! Although I did not manage to get a good working model, this was a fantastic learning experience.
